## What is this?

We believe that software developers should be able to participate in the global marketplace on the merit of
their capabilities, wherever they happen to live in the world.

_Functional Africa_ is a program to provide education in Functional Programming to aspiring developers in
Africa, and to seek ways to make it easier for them to participate in a global economy that is increasingly open
to remote workers, without artificial barriers.

We are just beginning on our journey towards charitable status, and starting in 2021, we will begin a program of
free, interactive, online teaching in Scala.

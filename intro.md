## What is this?

We believe that software developers should be able to participate in the global marketplace on the merit of
their capabilities, wherever in the world they were born.

_Functional Africa_ is a program to provide education in Functional Programming to aspiring developers in
Africa who don't have access to the same teaching that tech's long-established communitys in Europe and America
enjoy.

We want to make it easier for developers in Africa to participate in a global economy that is increasingly open
to remote work, without artificial barriers. We want it to be easier for anyone to apply for a remote job in
Haskell or Scala, and easier for employers to hire them, without artificial barriers 

The Internet is open. Africa is coming online. And the world is waking up to remote work.

Functional Scala is just beginning on its journey towards charitable status. Starting in 2021, we will begin
a program of free, interactive, online teaching in Scala.

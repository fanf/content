## Education

Change is difficult, and can take decades. But the most entrenched, lasting changes come about gradually and
steadily, and are the hardest to undo.

It is our goal to focus our particular talents, functional programming, on the people who can benefit the most
from them.

__That starts with education.__

We are ready to start providing free training to developers all over Africa.
